# WilhelmSKLibrary

Originally designed to allow users create custom WilhelmSK gauges using Swift, but can be used to develop quickly and easily create Signal K iOS and Mac apps 

It currently only uses periodic REST calls to get data, I can add WebSocket streamning if there is any demand,

You also need to add a package dependency to https://github.com/sbender9/WilhelmSKDummyGauges

Swift PLayground and an iOS/Mac example included above
